# Prediction-of-Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Severity-using-various-Data-Mining-methodologies-in-R-
Using the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision Data, the severity of the accident was predicted based on the number of persons injured, killed and location. This will help the public to know how safe or dangerous the intersections are in NYC. The important features were selected using Random Forest. The features selected by the Random Forest was fed into the following classification algorithms K- Nearest Neighbor, Naive-Bayes, CART, C5.0, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network. On comparison, C 5.0 was found to provide more accurate results than the other models
